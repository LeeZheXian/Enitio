For the maze, in a set of maze, there will be 5 maze. Each maze is a 2 player control. So 10 people will be playing in each set. 
Each maze has 2 servo motors, 2 joysticks and one lcd/oled screen... the set will have 1 point system.

Each player will control the maze with a joystick. The joystick will control each servo which is the axis of the maze.
 
The oled, functions to indicate to the user which hole they are to drop the metal ball in. The holes will be marked with a marker, which will indicate to the user which holes to drop it in.

Once the correct hole detect the metal balls dropping. It will send a signal to increase the point system. Wrong hole will deduct it.

You can make the code like space teams with its multiplayer and master.
